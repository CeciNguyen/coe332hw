Homework 1: My Name is Git Push

In this directory, it contains the first three exercises for homework 1.

For the first problem, I found the 5 longest words in the file 'words' and printed them out from longest to shortest.

For the second problem, I found 5 first names from the library of names that had 8 characters in it by utilizing a while loop.

For the third problem, I generated 5 different full names from the library of names and found their corresponding length without the spaces. I did this by utilizing a loop and creating a function.
