# Undone (The Sweater Container) - Homework 05 - Analyzing the ISS Data with Smarter Software  

## What to Expect?
Within the folder, you will find a python script named "iss_tracker.py". 
This file contains different app routes thatwill help the user obtain and manipulate 
parts of the data. The second file you will find is an assembled docker file named
"Dockerfile" that contains commands for building a new image for iss-tracker.py. 

## The ISS Data Set
So, how exactly are you supposed to access the data set? Great question! You would need to open up a browser and visit
this link: **[ISS Data Set](https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/trajectory_data.cfm)**

From there, you will see that you have the option to download the data set as a TXT file or an XML file. For the 
purposes of this python script, you would need to download the XML file. The data set provides position and velocity
data generated by the ISS Trajectory Operations and Planning Officer flight controllers at NASA!

## The Flask App and How to Use it

### What is it?
The flask application is written in the python script "iss_tracker.py". It is mainly used for querying the ISS position 
and velocity data through various app routes!

### How to Access it?
In order to actually run the application:

1. Log into your vm in two seperate command line windows using:
``username-vm``
2. Then in one of the windows run the debugger server using:
``flask --app app --debug run``
3. Once the server is running, you can then start inputting the different queries in the other window you logged into
4. To run the queries, you must use the command:
``curl localhost:5000``

## Try it Out!

### What are the Different Queries?
In this python script, there are eight different routes you can experiment with.

1. If you want to retrieve the whole entire data set, you can input:

``curl localhost:5000/``

This will return the whole entire data set as a dictionary. So if you see your screen flash with a bunch of numbers, 
do not be alarmed! That is just the computer communicating that it was able to turn the XML file into a readable 
dictionary for you to manipulate.

2. If you want to see all of the Epochs in the data set, you can input:

``curl localhost:5000/epochs``

This will return all of the Epochs ***ONLY***. You will multiple lines that look like:

> 2023-048T12:04:00.000Z

3. Now, what if you want to see a set of Epochs starting from the middle of the data set? You can now add a query parameter: limit and offset!
So if you would like to see the Epochs 10 through 14, you would input:

``curl localhost:5000/epochs?limit=4&offset=9``

Since the computer starts printing from index 0, you would want your offset to equal the Epoch that you want - 1 (ex: 6th Epoch = offset of 5).
You will most likely see a list that looks like this:

> [ 
>
>  "2023-082T11:48:00.000Z",
>
>  "2023-082T11:52:00.000Z",
>
>  "2023-082T11:56:00.000Z",
>
>  "2023-082T12:00:00.000Z"
>
> ]

4. If you want to see the state vectors for a specific Epoch, you can input:

``curl localhost:5000/epochs/(an integer)``

So, if you wanted to see the second Epoch data set, you would want to put:

``curl localhost:5000/epochs/2``

This will return the data set that belongs to the specific Epoch! You will see something along the lines of:

> X = -5998.4652356788401
>
> Y= 391.26194859011099
>
> Z = -3164.26047476557
>
> X_DOT = -2.8799691318087701
>
> Y_DOT = -5.2020406581448801
>
> Z_DOT = 4.8323394499086101

5. If you want to see the speed for a specific Epoch in the data set, you can input:

``curl localhost:5000/epochs/(an integer)/speed``

So if you wanted to see the second Epoch's speed, you would type:

``curl localhost:5000/epochs/2/speed``

This will return a float! 

6. If you need a friendly reminder of what each app route does, you are in luck! In order to see each app route and their function, just input:

``curl localhost:5000/help``

This will return a list of app routes provided in the file and their descriptions.

7. Let's say that you notice that the data set you are using is outdated, well no problem! You can delete the current data that you have stored using:

``curl localhost:5000/delete-data -X DELETE``

It is important to note that you must need the: `` -X DELETE`` because the action for the app route is not 'GET' like the previous routes. So if you forget that part of the command, it will return an error. 

To test if you cleared the data, you can try to run:

``curl localhost:5000/``

and it should return an empty data set.

8. In order to get updated data, you should input: 

``curl localhost:5000/post-data -X POST`` 

After you delete your data, you need to reload the data using post in order to run the other routes! And just like with the "delete-data" route, you need to make sure to have the ``-X POST`` in the command for the route to do its action.
